# Cashvoid

Backend and frontend for cashvoid.com, an art project created by Joseph Spencer.

It contains a series of AI features meant to convey ideas which are uncanny, ghastly and queer.

This will be hosted on AWS and use an EC2 to run python scripts for chatting and generating images. 

Chatting will probably utilize GPT-4 Mini to keep wait times low while keeping costs manageable.

Image generation will be done twice daily from a home server PC.
